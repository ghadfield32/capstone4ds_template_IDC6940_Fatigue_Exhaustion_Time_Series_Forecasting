# Introduction

## Project Overview

Fatigue and injury risk modeling are essential components of modern sports analytics, especially for basketball athletes. Accurately predicting fatigue levels and injury risks can significantly optimize training, enhance performance, and prolong athlete careers. 

---

## Deep Learning Approach

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)—are well-suited to capturing sequential and temporal patterns inherent in physiological and biomechanical athlete data.

Recent studies underline the critical link between fatigue accumulation and increased injury risk, emphasizing the need for precise temporal modeling. 

---

## Project Goals

This capstone project employs LSTM models to forecast fatigue levels (`exhaustion_rate`) and classify joint injury risks (`injury_risk`) during basketball shooting trials. The goal is to support injury prevention strategies and optimize athletic performance using biomechanical and physiological insights.

---

## Sequence Analysis

In looking on a granular level we found that shooting motion sequences are of different lengths if we wanted to try and assess real time granular metrics.

We can possibly forecast injury's as high as 2 sequences in the future so I evaluated:
- Hierarchical dynamic time warping
- Distributed padding
- Basic set_window approach 

---

## Key Literature

Research informing this approach:

- **Athlete Burnout:** Individualized factors (stress, training load, recovery support) significantly influence injury risks, suggesting the need for personalized interventions.

- **Fatigue Data Collection:** Datasets capturing muscle activity, biomechanics, and physiological fatigue indicators serve as foundational resources.

# Modeling and Results

## Model Selection Criteria

In selecting the appropriate forecasting model, we evaluated:

- **Stationarity-based** models (ARIMA, N-BEATS)
- **Adaptive** deep learning models (LSTM variants)

---

## Stationarity-Based Models {.smaller}

### ARIMA and N-BEATS Characteristics

- **Assumption of Stationarity**  
  Statistical properties remain constant over time

- **Preprocessing Overhead**  
  - **Differencing (ARIMA):** Requires removing trends/seasonality  
  - **Basis Expansion (N-BEATS):** Uses basis functions for components

---

## Stationarity-Based Models (cont.) {.smaller}

- **Interpretability**  
  - **ARIMA:** Clear parameter semantics (p, d, q)
  - **N-BEATS:** Provides decomposed outputs

- **Data Requirements**  
  - Effective on moderate-sized datasets with stable patterns
  - Struggles with regime shifts or non-linear interactions

---

## When to Choose Stationarity Models

---

## When to Choose Adaptive Models

> **Best when:** Your biomechanical and physiological data exhibit complex, non-linear dynamics and potential regime changes (e.g., sudden fatigue spikes), and you have sufficient data and compute budget.

---

## Our Approach

For our fatigue progression and injury risk prediction:

1. **Standard LSTM** for baseline temporal pattern learning
2. **Bidirectional LSTM** to enhance detection of pre-injury signals
3. **TCN-LSTM Hybrid** for capturing multi-scale biomechanical fluctuations

These choices balance model flexibility, performance, and deployment feasibility.
