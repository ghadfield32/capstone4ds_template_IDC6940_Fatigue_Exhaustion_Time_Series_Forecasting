## Introduction

Fatigue and injury risk modeling have become pivotal in sports analytics, particularly for baseball pitchers. Predicting fatigue levels and assessing injury risk help in optimizing training programs and enhancing athlete longevity. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), offer significant potential due to their ability to capture temporal patterns and sequential dependencies, critical in physiological and biomechanical data analysis.

Recent developments have showcased that fatigue accumulation can directly impact injury susceptibility, highlighting the importance of accurately modeling temporal fatigue progression. This project aims to leverage LSTM models to effectively forecast fatigue levels and predict joint injury risks in baseball pitchers, contributing valuable insights for injury prevention strategies and optimized athletic performance.

Previous research on LSTM's efficacy in fatigue modeling forms the basis of our methodological approach, emphasizing the use of biomechanical and simulated physiological data.

## Methods

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that typically hinders standard RNNs when modeling long-term dependencies. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs utilize gating mechanisms to selectively retain or discard information over sequences.

The core components of an LSTM cell include:

- **Forget Gate:**  
  $$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$  
  Determines which information to remove from the cell state.

- **Input Gate:**  
  $$i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$$  
  $$\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$$  
  Decides which new candidate values to add to the cell state.

- **Cell State Update:**  
  $$C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$$

- **Output Gate:**  
  $$o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$$  
  $$h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)$$  
  Controls the information output to the next hidden state.

Here, \( W \) and \( b \) represent weights and biases, respectively, \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, and \( \odot \) is element-wise multiplication.

Compared to standard RNNs, LSTMs are especially effective in handling data with temporal correlations—making them suitable for modeling fatigue progression and injury risk in sequential biomechanical and physiological data.

Abstract

In this capstone project, we leverage real athlete data from Driveline Baseball alongside novel sensor measurements to predict fatigue and joint injury risks in baseball pitchers. Using an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the project combines biomechanical data with simulated physiological metrics. Two parallel pipelines—one for regression (predicting trial exhaustion rates) and another for classification (identifying joint injury risk)—are developed. This work integrates advanced feature engineering, temporal dynamics, and modular data preprocessing, offering robust insights for injury prevention and performance analytics. Introduction

Recent advances in sports science have underscored the importance of combining biomechanical and physiological data for injury prevention. In my internship at Driveline Baseball, the dataset was upgraded to include real athlete data. To further enhance the analysis, this project incorporates EMG sensors to capture muscle contraction, acceleration, and gyroscopic measurements during the pitching motion. These additional measurements—placed on the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and other key muscles—aim to improve the prediction of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries.

Two resources support this work:

```         
The raw sensor data is being compiled and will be available at emg_fatigue_analysis.

A pre-established pipeline for LSTM-based fatigue prediction is available at LSTM RNN Pipeline.
```

Literature Review

The literature indicates that predicting fatigue and injury risk in athletes requires an integration of biomechanical outputs with physiological signals. Key findings from previous studies include:

```         
Athlete Burnout: Research has shown that burnout is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., stress, training load, support systems) that vary among athletes. Customizing training and recovery protocols based on individual warning signs may mitigate injury risks.

Fatigue Data Collection: Detailed datasets have been published to capture muscle activity, motion capture data, and self-reported fatigue levels during shoulder rotations. These resources serve as a foundation for building predictive algorithms.

Methodological Advances: Recent studies have applied neural network architectures to model fatigue—such as a fully-connected network for predicting crack growth in metals [DOI: 10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.107402]—and used combined physical and physiological workload metrics to forecast injury risk in professional soccer players [DOI: 10.52082/jssm.2024.537].
```

These studies, along with tutorials on SHAP values and Bayesian optimization from DataCamp, inform our approach to feature engineering and model selection. Methodology Data Loading and Preprocessing

The project begins by merging a CSV file containing trial-level measurements (e.g., joint energy and power) with participant metadata using unique identifiers like trial_id and player_participant_id. Rigorous data cleaning (including imputation and removal of missing values) is performed with comprehensive logging and debugging routines. Feature Engineering

Key features derived in this project include:

```         
Joint Metrics: Aggregated joint energy and power are computed to serve as primary indicators of physical output.

Simulated Physiological Measures: A simulated heart rate is calculated as a function of mean and joint energy. In addition, “fake body” metrics (sleep quality, sleep duration, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and stress index) are introduced to mimic wearable sensor data.

Temporal Dynamics: Lag features (e.g., previous trial exhaustion) and rolling statistics (moving averages, volatility measures) capture trends across trials. The trial exhaustion rate is defined as the change in exhaustion per trial.

Asymmetry Features: Differences between left and right joint metrics are measured to detect imbalances that may predispose athletes to injury.

Workout Simulation

To mimic the progression of fatigue:

```         
Workout 1: Contains the original 125 trials.

Workout 2: Is a duplicate of the original trials but simulates gradual deterioration in fake body metrics (e.g., lower sleep quality, higher resting heart rate) by adding a workout_id and trial counter. These two datasets are concatenated to form a comprehensive dataset for subsequent modeling.
```

Predictive Modeling Pipelines Pipeline 1: Regression for Predicting Trial Exhaustion Rate

```         
Input Features: Aggregated joint metrics, simulated physiological features, and temporal features.

Model: A baseline linear regression model is used, with future plans to incorporate Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM networks.

Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R², along with visualizations comparing predicted versus actual exhaustion rates.
```

Pipeline 2: Classification for Predicting Joint Injury Risk

```         
Input Features: Joint-specific metrics, asymmetry measurements, and cumulative load indicators.

Labeling: Trials are classified as high injury risk if a rolling sum of joint stress exceeds a threshold (e.g., the 75th percentile).

Model: Initially, logistic regression or decision tree classifiers are employed. Future work may involve Random Forests or neural network-based methods.

Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used, supplemented by feature importance analyses using SHAP values.
```

Integration and Modularity

Both pipelines share common preprocessing and feature engineering modules, ensuring that the workflow is modular and reproducible. Visualization tools—including histograms, correlation matrices, and temporal trend plots—are used throughout the analysis to validate each transformation step. Experimental Results

The LSTM-based regression model for fatigue prediction demonstrated promising results:

```         
MSE: 0.00596

MAE: 0.01762

R² Score: 0.91808
```

Similarly, the injury risk classifier achieved strong performance:

```         
Overall Accuracy: 98.16%

Precision: 93.84%

Recall: 99.77%

F1 Score: 96.72%
```

Joint-specific models yielded varying metrics, reflecting the inherent complexity of localized biomechanical data. Discussion

This project illustrates the successful application of deep learning to model fatigue and predict injury risk in a real-world sports setting. Key challenges included managing the variability in biomechanical signals and optimizing model performance through careful feature engineering. The integration of temporal dynamics and asymmetry features was critical in capturing the underlying physiological responses. Future work may explore attention mechanisms or hybrid architectures to further refine predictive accuracy. Conclusion

By combining real athlete data with simulated physiological metrics, this capstone project provides a novel approach to predicting fatigue and injury risks in baseball pitchers. The dual-pipeline strategy (regression and classification) along with modular integration of preprocessing and feature engineering modules establishes a robust framework that is transparent, reproducible, and adaptable for future research and practical deployment.
