# Introduction

Fatigue and injury risk modeling are essential components of modern sports analytics, especially for basketball athletes. Accurately predicting fatigue levels and injury risks can significantly optimize training, enhance performance, and prolong athlete careers. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)—are well-suited to capturing sequential and temporal patterns inherent in physiological and biomechanical athlete data.

Recent studies underline the critical link between fatigue accumulation and increased injury risk, emphasizing the need for precise temporal modeling. This capstone project employs LSTM models to forecast fatigue levels (`exhaustion_rate`) and classify joint injury risks (`injury_risk`) during basketball shooting trials. The goal is to support injury prevention strategies and optimize athletic performance using biomechanical and physiological insights.

In looking on a granular level we found that shooting motion sequences are of different lengths if we wanted to try and assess real time granular metrics, we can possibly forecast injury's as high as 2 sequences in the future so I evaluated hieararchical dynamic time warping, distributed padding, and the basic set_window approach to setting up the sequences to see which would be best in terms of forecasting in the near future and the results are below.

Key literature informing this approach:

-   **Athlete Burnout:** Individualized factors (stress, training load, recovery support) significantly influence injury risks, suggesting the need for personalized interventions.
-   **Fatigue Data Collection:** Datasets capturing muscle activity, biomechanics, and physiological fatigue indicators serve as foundational resources.
-   **Methodological Advances:**

| \# Modeling and Results |
| \### LSTM-Based Architectures |
| We explored several variations of LSTM-based architectures to capture temporal dependencies in the biomechanical and physiological data: |
| 1\. **Standard LSTM** - Architecture: LSTM(64) → Dropout(0.2) → LSTM(32) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(horizon) - Usage: - Sequential data with clear forward temporal dependencies - Real-time predictions where future context isn't available - Basic motion pattern recognition in joint movements - Pros: - Computationally efficient - Lower memory requirements - Easier to train and tune - Good for online/streaming predictions - Cons: - Can miss patterns that require future context - May struggle with complex temporal relationships - Limited ability to capture long-range dependencies |
| 2\. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** - Architecture: BiLSTM(64) → Dropout(0.2) → BiLSTM(32) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(horizon) - Usage: - Post-hoc analysis of complete movement sequences - Pattern recognition requiring both past and future context - Identifying complex biomechanical relationships - Pros: - Better pattern recognition through bidirectional context - Improved accuracy for complex sequences - Better at capturing long-term dependencies - Cons: - Double the computational cost - Cannot be used for real-time predictions - Requires full sequences for prediction - More prone to overfitting on small datasets |
| 3\. **TCN-LSTM Hybrid** - Architecture: TCN(64) → Dropout(0.2) → LSTM(32) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(horizon) - Usage: - Data with both local and global temporal patterns - Scenarios requiring precise temporal hierarchy - Complex motion sequences with varying time scales - Pros: - Better at capturing multi-scale temporal patterns - Parallel processing capabilities - More stable gradients - Fixed receptive field helps with interpretability - Cons: - More hyperparameters to tune - Higher computational complexity - May require larger datasets for effective training - Can be overkill for simple temporal patterns |
| 4\. **TCN-BiLSTM Hybrid** - Architecture: BiTCN(64) → Dropout(0.2) → BiLSTM(32) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(horizon) - Usage: - Complex biomechanical sequences requiring multi-scale analysis - High-precision movement analysis - Research scenarios where maximum model capacity is needed - Pros: - Highest model capacity - Best at capturing complex temporal relationships - Combines benefits of all previous architectures - Superior performance on complex patterns - Cons: - Highest computational cost - Most complex to tune - Requires largest datasets - Highest risk of overfitting - Longest training time |
| Common Parameters Across All Architectures: - Optimizer: Adam - Loss Function: MSE - Metrics: MAE - Batch Size: 32 - Initial Epochs: 10 |
| Selection Criteria: - Dataset Size: Simpler architectures for smaller datasets - Computational Resources: Standard LSTM for limited resources - Prediction Requirements: BiLSTM variants only for offline analysis - Pattern Complexity: More complex architectures for intricate temporal patterns - Real-time Needs: Standard LSTM or TCN-LSTM for online predictions |
| Core LSTM Mathematics: - **Forget Gate:** $$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$ |
| \- **Input Gate:** $$i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$$ $$\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$$ |
| \- **Cell State Update:** $$C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$$ |
| \- **Output Gate:** $$o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$$ $$h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)$$ |
| *Where ( W ) and ( b ) represent weights and biases, (* \sigma ) is the sigmoid function, and ( \odot ) denotes element-wise multiplication. |
| \### Preprocessing Approaches |
| \- Clipped physiological metrics (joint_exhaustion_rates) with minimum of 0 - Scaling numerical features - filtering low null columns and imputing higher volume nulls - checked z-score for suspicious variables |

This is an introduction to ….. regression, which is a non-parametric estimator that estimates the conditional expectation of two variables which is random. The goal of a kernel regression is to discover the non-linear relationship between two random variables. To discover the non-linear relationship, kernel estimator or kernel smoothing is the main method to estimate the curve for non-parametric statistics. In kernel estimator, weight function is known as kernel function (Efromovich 2008). Cite this paper (Bro and Smilde 2014). The GEE (Wang 2014). The PCA (Daffertshofer et al. 2004). Topology can be used in machine learning (Adams and Moy 2021)

The common non-parametric regression model is , where can be defined as the sum of the regression function value for . Here is unknown and some errors. With the help of this definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e. can be estimated with the product of average and is near to

. In other words, this means that we are discovering the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data points. The estimation formula is printed below (R Core Team 2019):
