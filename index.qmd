# Project Overview

This research project explores the application of deep learning techniques to predict and prevent injuries in basketball players by analyzing biomechanical data and fatigue patterns. The work combines state-of-the-art LSTM architectures with comprehensive biomechanical datasets to create predictive models for athlete monitoring.

## Key Objectives

1. Develop predictive models for:
   - Exhaustion rate progression during basketball movements
   - Joint-specific injury risks based on biomechanical patterns
2. Create a real-time monitoring framework for practical implementation
3. Establish interpretable metrics for coaches and training staff

## Problem Statement

Athletes face increasing injury risks due to accumulated fatigue, particularly in high-intensity sports like basketball. The complex temporal patterns in biomechanical data make it challenging to predict and prevent injuries effectively. This project addresses the critical need for real-time monitoring solutions that can:

- Prevent career-threatening injuries through early detection
- Optimize training regimens based on individual fatigue patterns
- Enhance performance longevity through data-driven decisions

# Data & Methodology

## Dataset Description

The project utilizes the SPL Open Biomechanics Dataset, comprising:

- 125 basketball shooting trials
- Comprehensive joint metrics and movement patterns
- Physiological indicators from wearable sensors

### Feature Set

```python
features = {
    'Joint Metrics': ['energy', 'power'],
    'Physiological': ['heart_rate', 'wearable_metrics'],
    'Temporal': ['exhaustion_rate', 'rolling_averages'],
    'Asymmetry': ['joint_differences']
}
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

Our preprocessing workflow follows a systematic approach:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removal of outliers and noise
   - Handling missing values
   - Signal smoothing for sensor data

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Temporal Features:
     - Rolling windows for pattern detection
     - Lagged variables for time-series analysis
     - Rate calculations for progression tracking
   
   - Biomechanical Indices:
     - Joint asymmetry scores
     - Energy expenditure calculations
     - Power distribution metrics

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Normalization of input features
   - Sequence preparation for temporal models
   - Train/test split with temporal consideration

# Model Architecture

## LSTM-Based Models

### Standard LSTM Implementation

This base architecture serves as our foundation for temporal pattern recognition:

```python
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(32),
    Dense(horizon)
])
```

**Characteristics:**
- Fast training time
- Efficient memory usage
- High prediction speed
- Suitable for real-time applications

### Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)

Enhanced architecture for complex pattern recognition:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(32)),
    Dense(horizon)
])
```

**Key Advantages:**
- Improved pattern recognition through bidirectional context
- Better handling of complex sequences
- Enhanced long-term dependency capture

### TCN-LSTM Hybrid

Advanced architecture combining temporal convolutional networks with LSTM:

```python
model = Sequential([
    TCN(64),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(32),
    Dense(horizon)
])
```

**Benefits:**
- Superior multi-scale temporal pattern recognition
- Efficient parallel processing
- Improved gradient stability
